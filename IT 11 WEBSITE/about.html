      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
I'm Heartlyn Nichole J. Justo ,19 years old and live in the  Laoag city. I'm currently a bs entrepreneurship student at Mariano Marcos State University, I take this course because i always dream to become a businesswom. I love exploring things that new to me like doing crazy things and hanging out with friends. I'm always passionate on what I'm doing. I love cooking, reading books and staying at home, I'm the type of person that loves to just stay at home rather than going outside. I prefer being alone sometimes, because when I'm alone there will be no judgement from others. I want my future to be as awesome as I am, i want to build a business someday.
